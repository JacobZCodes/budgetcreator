# budgetcreator
A primitive Python program that parses a PDF of dummy card statements and returns another PDF that categorizes the expenditures.

This program's purpose is to read in a PDF of someone's card statements for the month and return another PDF where the expenditures are categorized into
different categories like GROCERIES or AUTO. In the real world, this program would hopefully help someone quickly see where their money is going
each month so they can then budget appropriately for next time. The 'December, 2022.pdf' file provided is a dummy file I found online.
